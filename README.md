Older versions of spreadsheet formatted MIxS standard templates (up to version 5).

Note that before version 4, MIxS was not released as a single standard, but rather as a set of checklists. Those lists are available here in the folders labeled pre-2009, 2009, 2010, 2011.

Older versions of MIxS and checklists were released as .xls files. Those files are available here, along with a new version saved in the open source .xslx format. Some of the oldest files are available as .docx and .xds (in the pre-2009 folder).

**To request changes to the MIxS standards, please use the [issue tracker in the main MIxS repostiory](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues).**

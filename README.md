Spreadsheet formatted MIxS standard templates

Note that before version 4, MIxS was not released as a single standard, but rather as a set of checklists. Those lists are available here in the folders labeled pre-2009, 2009, 2010, 2011.

Older versions of MIxS and checklists were released as .xls files. Those files are available here, along with a new version saved in the open source .xslx format.
